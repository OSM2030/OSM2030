Hello, I'm Omkar Mhaske.

I am a student of Computer Science and Design who builds projects with Python, Django, and APIs. My work includes a Food Redistribution Platform and a Job Portal API. I also have experience from the Amazon ML Challenge.

I am currently expanding my skills in Data Science, AI, and deployment tools like TensorFlow and Docker.
